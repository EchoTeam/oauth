This is demo server (built on top of the Echo OAuth server framework) and a
client to test that.

To run:

1. Replace 'CHANGE.THIS.NOW' with the host name where the server will run in
files sample.config and client.erl.

2. Run `make run-server` to start the server.

3. Run `make run-client` to start the client. It will print an authorization
URL to follow.
