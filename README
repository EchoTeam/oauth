Erlang implementation of OAuth client and server by Echo

Copyright (c) 2008-2010 Jacknyfe, Inc. (dba Echo). All rights reserved.

Client
======

The client is interoperable with OAuth 1.0 and 1.0a servers.

For documentation and samples please check out oauthclient.erl and test.erl.


Server
======

The server conforms to OAuth 1.0 spec.

Check out demo/ directory for a sample server.


dummy_server
============

The dummy server (dummy_server.erl) is basically a stub server (started by
`make run`) used for testing the client (test:run()).

Build procedure
===============

The code is built with BSD make. Make sure that YAWS_EBIN in the Makefile
points to the location where Yaws beams reside.
